# DAOGE - alpha
dao for renDoge peace proposals

Starts with an Admin, who can add more Admins and Users.

Users must have at least a balance of 50,000 renDoge to create a proposal.

Proposals can be filtered and deleted by Admins.

Future functionality can include renDoge based shareholding, and the instantiation of a DAOGE treasury for funding proposals.
